# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom: A Machine Learning Approach

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to analyze telecom customer data to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. The primary focus is to identify customers at high risk of leaving the service, understand the key factors influencing churn, and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention and business profitability.

Key Objectives:
- Develop a predictive model to classify customers as churn or non-churn.
- Identify the most influential features driving customer churn.
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and enhance customer loyalty.

## 2. Data Sources
- [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) - Contains customer demographics, service usage, and churn status.
- Additional internal telecom service data (if applicable).

## 3. Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Model Explainability: LIME
- Machine Learning Frameworks: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
- Version Control: Git
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## 5. Summary of Findings
### 5.1 Business Insight
- Customers with shorter contract durations (month-to-month) are more likely to churn.
- Fiber optic internet service users exhibit higher churn rates compared to DSL or no internet service.
- Features like tenure, monthly charges, and paperless billing status significantly affect churn likelihood.
- Service add-ons such as online security and device protection help reduce churn risk.

### 5.2 Actionable Recommendations
- Promote longer-term contracts by offering incentives to reduce churn.
- Improve fiber optic service quality and customer support to address dissatisfaction.
- Enhance communication and usability of paperless billing to lower churn associated with this feature.
- Develop targeted retention campaigns focusing on customers with short tenure and high monthly charges.
- Bundle device protection and online security services to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
